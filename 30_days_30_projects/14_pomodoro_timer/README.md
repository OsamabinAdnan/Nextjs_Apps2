## The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. The technique consists of:

1. Selecting a task to focus on
2. Setting a timer for 25-30 minutes of focused work
3. Taking a 5-minute break
4. Repeating the cycle
5. Taking a longer break (20-30 minutes) after 4 cycles
